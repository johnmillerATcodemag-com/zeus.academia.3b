```text
Create a prompt to create a AI Assisted Software Development Process instruction file.
The instructions should include guidance for AI generated code, AI code reviews,
Human Code reviews, and Human PR approvals. Be optimized for AI agents and to
minimize the token requirements. The instruction file should contain an instruction
to update the Project Overview instruction file with a reference to itself.
```
